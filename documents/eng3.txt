Barbecue varies by the type of meat, sauce, rub, or other flavorings used, at which point in barbecuing they are added, the role smoke plays, the equipment and fuel used, cooking temperature, and cooking time.

The meat might be ground, for hamburgers, or processed into sausage or kebabs. The meat may be marinated or rubbed with spices before cooking, basted with a sauce or oil before cooking, during cooking, after cooking, or any combination of these.
